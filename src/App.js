                No, there’s nothing I'd rather talk about right now than Peter
                Molyneux's balls. THESE ARE SHEETS FOR FUCKING IN. This Quick
                Look is over! It's like I'm in a techno womb. Show me a mommy
                Mario. My forehead hasn't grown with the rest of my body. Suck
                on it, Ron Weasley. Fuck your milk! They're basically sperm.
                Jeff, I have a question. Why do we keep doing this? Go to hell.
                Blocked. You're just anti-people-believing-in-things. How weird
                is the existence of the Christmas tree farmer? I already live in
                a world without Batman and it fucking suuuucks. Goku's like the
                Huell Howser of anime. Fuck you, Brad Garrett! I hope you burn
                in hell!
              </p>

            I'm a dick, and I want to subject other people to that. You're
            talking about sex, right? Sometimes there are cuts where you don't
            expect them to be. I'm talking about your butthole. Can I ask you
            why you're saying 'booty'? I'm not gonna eat a supernatural
            anything. Yeah, you like getting it both ways, don't you? Once you
            hit 30 you can't do shots. Good Old Raisins and Peanuts! GORP! You
            guys never heard of GORP? I just magic'd in my pants. You are
            history's greatest monster. I WILL CONTINUE TO CALL PAX AUSTRALIA
            PAXA UNTIL IT FUCKING CATCHES ON. I'm going to ride my fucking
            resentment into a fucking volcano! She's reading your mind with her
            scary eyes. Now that wolf is gonna fuck that pig. I'm gonna no scope
            these crops. You can't out-engineer a fucking chainsaw. You're just
            jealous of other peoples' hot news. Take that you shitty wizard.
            Because the Dutch are cheap. You won't know you're playing SimCity
            once you smoke all them bath salts, Jeff. The laziest dubstep is
            arguably the best dubstep. I always get run over from behind.
            Alright, now I'm not gonna wash my hands, and I'm gonna take these
            cookies. You could put a GoPro on a bear pretty easy. So this is a
            parable for communism. Let's play some meat! You diseased piece of
            shit. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. Just gonna
            masturbate under my invisible cloak, don't mind me. You need to spit
            on it first. It makes me angry how fucking much I enjoy this game. I
            didn't come here to get harassed by asshole teenagers, I get enough
            of that as it is. You are Bathroom Guy. Well, you're trying to get
            her pregnant, right? I am the hat judge. Show me a hat and I will
            tell you if it's a good hat or bad hat. I want a game that is
            nothing but kicking dumpsters at enemies. This is skin-peelingly
            bad. Being in the tub with someone else's poop, there are few things
            that are just as sheer terrible. Hey E3, maybe stop farting for five
            seconds. I hate Game Room so much. It's sad that I lost my leg, but
            let's not let it go to waste. Fight-or-flight kicks in immediately
            when you see a man shitting in his own hand. John McTiernan, master
            of modern fucking action movies. The man made Predator, god dammit!
            If you're gonna sit there and tell me Renny Harlin made a better
            movie than him, you are all assholes and I don't want to work with
            you anymore! On death, all hummingbirds explode. Oh, Dennis Leary is
            in this for no good reason. Moral of the story here is do not make
            any sort of accords with laser-shooting wolves. I don't believe in
            wheels. He's making meth. You know what, Jeff? If you were a man,
            you'd be wearing a hat right now. He's like the J.R.R. Tolkien of
            being shitty. I hate watching you drink warm soda. It's bad for you
            and it's bad for the soda. This is what sadomasochism will look like
            in the future. You are looking for far too much logical consistency.
            You're carrying around a Lego baby, Gary. Where's the real baby? No
            one should ever put clothes on a shark. Give me access to your
            members-only site of hot mommy Marios. I feel like I'm gonna throw
            up, but in a good way. Everyone's so obsessed with the Link thing,
            no one ever asks, like, is that the same Mario every time? It's easy
            to piss off Batman. Doesn't take much. I have a problematic toilet.
            My dick doesn't have tits. The day spa is the ultimate high-stakes
            "is this a public space it's OK to be naked in?" scenario. Vinny,
            you and I both, crazy Potterheads. It's like potheads, but for Harry
            Potter. We were talking about furries and yiffing and GenCon. Did
            you know? Babies can't eat Legos. Fact. CHINA DON'T CARE. Harry
            Potter and the 9/11 Conspiracy. I played Ms. Pac-Man. It's pretty
            good. I decided this weekend that it's about communism. It's 18
            years old, Daytona USA. You could fuck it if you wanted to. Timmy,
            you're not a converted Primal Rage arcade cabinet, Timmy! You're a
            stupid dog! I want you to go to hell. I hate socks. BLOCKED. I am
            the street! Gimme that horsey sauce. There's a lot of face and neck
            stabbing, if you like to stab dudes in the face and neck. What
            PopCap game do you think the Master Chief would like the most? You
            would not have the time to retaliate while you're watching this man
            shit in his own hand, preparing to fling it at you. There's too much
            stuff inside this Hot Pocket. Seattle is actually Spanish for
            "taco." Those penguins are shitting Pong balls. Or, snow balls. Or I
            guess shit balls, is what they are. Get your thumb out of your ass
            and try playing games for once, why don't ya. The Kool-Aid Man never
            had a flamethrower. I try not to affiliate myself with Canadians.
            Too much in your wet diaper? Let's put our frowns on upside down,
            and eat my buddy's leg. You're saying pipes don't have rights?
            Fuckin' helicopters are the worst! They're trying to kill you as you
            get in them. I've got a salty mustache. I am not smart enough to
            know what any of that shit means. Who knows what direction that poop
            is gonna take. Explain Baby Mario. Being there, and then all of the
            sudden, poop floats up, hits the surface. Infinite beards. The cops
            are here for the crimes against video games you've committed, Sonic.
            I want it on this table. Are Depends real? Are adult diapers real?
            Fuck your box!! You're banned, you're banned, you're Nintendo
            banned! Oh, don't front, Jeff. You were already pooping your pants
            before we even started recording. Can we enhance this? And Space
            Pope himself, Mr. Patrick Klepek. You people are abject porn
            monsters. You know what's not the new sweat? Hitler. I fuckin' love
            Game Room. What a piece of shit. What an incredible, half-assed
            piece of garbage this is. No rights for pipes, no rights for
            pipes... I hate Game Room. I hate it. I actively hate it. I hate
            sitting on the couch with you and looking at these stupid games.
            I've got milk that's older than him. I should probably throw out
            that milk. Hit the golf button. I've been a party to many, many
            stupid things in my life. This is by far the stupidest. I was
            dressed up like a pizza delivery guy; brought this F-bomb instead.
            It's dumb, but its not transcendentally dumb. Sheep are incredibly
            muscular. Penguins are dope. Hold on to your fucking hats,
            gentlemen. I like that this is where we're at on Game Room: not even
            games that were good enough to be put out. I will pay good money to
            see you as a dirty sexual predator. YO THOSE ARE FUCKING
            DOUBLE-UNDERLINE SICK. Don't milk a hippie. This is the result of
            trying to touch butts. Prove that video games are good. At first I
            cringe, but I want more. Why not just say KAIJU BATTLE ROBOT JOX?
            Can we agree that buffalo sauce on your asshole would not feel good?
            So you want a Hot Pocket with more pocket and less hot, is that what
            you're saying? You are a human piece of shit. I could talk about
            Peter Molyneux's balls for a long time. Exécutable? What the fuck
            are you saying!? It's like they'd never seen a video game before and
            they just decided, "Oh, this is the best one, cause I've seen one."
            This is like a fuckin' Woody Allen heist going on here. Caused all
            this collateral damage with my F-bombs.
