You're just anti-people-believing-in-things. How weird\n                is the existence of the Christmas tree farmer? I already live in\n                a world without Batman and it fucking suuuucks. Goku's like the\n                Huell Howser of anime. Fuck you, Brad Garrett!

You're\n            talking about sex, right? Sometimes there are cuts where you don't\n            expect them to be. I'm talking about your butthole. Can I ask you\n            why you're saying 'booty'? I'm not gonna eat a supernatural\n            anything. Yeah, you like getting it both ways, don't you? Once you\n            hit 30 you can't do shots. Good Old Raisins and Peanuts! GORP! You\n            guys never heard of GORP? I just magic'd in my pants. You are\n            history's greatest monster. I WILL CONTINUE TO CALL PAX AUSTRALIA\n            PAXA UNTIL IT FUCKING CATCHES ON. I'm going to ride my fucking\n            resentment into a fucking volcano! She's reading your mind with her\n            scary eyes. Now that wolf is gonna fuck that pig. I'm gonna no scope\n            these crops. You can't out-engineer a fucking chainsaw. You're just\n            jealous of other peoples' hot news. Take that you shitty wizard.\n            Because the Dutch are cheap. You won't know you're playing SimCity\n            once you smoke all them bath salts, Jeff. The laziest dubstep is\n            arguably the best dubstep. I always get run over from behind.\n            Alright, now I'm not gonna wash my hands, and I'm gonna take these\n            cookies. You could put a GoPro on a bear pretty easy. So this is a\n            parable for communism. Let's play some meat! You diseased piece of\n            shit. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. Just gonna\n            masturbate under my invisible cloak, don't mind me. You need to spit\n            on it first. It makes me angry how fucking much I enjoy this game. I\n            didn't come here to get harassed by asshole teenagers, I get enough\n            of that as it is. You are Bathroom Guy. Well, you're trying to get\n            her pregnant, right? I am the hat judge. Show me a hat and I will\n            tell you if it's a good hat or bad hat. I want a game that is\n            nothing but kicking dumpsters at enemies. This is skin-peelingly\n            bad. Being in the tub with someone else's poop, there are few things\n            that are just as sheer terrible. Hey E3, maybe stop farting for five\n            seconds. I hate Game Room so much. It's sad that I lost my leg, but\n            let's not let it go to waste. Fight-or-flight kicks in immediately\n            when you see a man shitting in his own hand. John McTiernan, master\n            of modern fucking action movies. The man made Predator, god dammit!\n            If you're gonna sit there and tell me Renny Harlin made a better\n            movie than him, you are all assholes and I don't want to work with\n            you anymore! On death, all hummingbirds explode. Oh, Dennis Leary is\n            in this for no good reason. Moral of the story here is do not make\n            any sort of accords with laser-shooting wolves. I don't believe in\n            wheels. He's making meth. You know what, Jeff? If you were a man,\n            you'd be wearing a hat right now. He's like the J.R.R. Tolkien of\n            being shitty. I hate watching you drink warm soda. It's bad for you\n            and it's bad for the soda. This is what sadomasochism will look like\n            in the future. You are looking for far too much logical consistency.\n            You're carrying around a Lego baby, Gary. Where's the real baby? No\n            one should ever put clothes on a shark. Give me access to your\n            members-only site of hot mommy Marios. I feel like I'm gonna throw\n            up, but in a good way. Everyone's so obsessed with the Link thing,\n            no one ever asks, like, is that the same Mario every time? It's easy\n            to piss off Batman. Doesn't take much. I have a problematic toilet.\n            My dick doesn't have tits. The day spa is the ultimate high-stakes\n            \"is this a public space it's OK to be naked in?\" scenario. Vinny,\n            you and I both, crazy Potterheads. It's like potheads, but for Harry\n            Potter. We were talking about furries and yiffing and GenCon. Did\n            you know? Babies can't eat Legos. Fact. CHINA DON'T CARE. Harry\n            Potter and the 9/11 Conspiracy. I played Ms. Pac-Man. It's pretty\n            good. I decided this weekend that it's about communism. It's 18\n            years old, Daytona USA. You could fuck it if you wanted to. Timmy,\n            you're not a converted Primal Rage arcade cabinet, Timmy! You're a\n            stupid dog! I want you to go to hell. I hate socks. BLOCKED. I am\n            the street! Gimme that horsey sauce. There's a lot of face and neck\n            stabbing, if you like to stab dudes in the face and neck. What\n            PopCap game do you think the Master Chief would like the most? You\n            would not have the time to retaliate while you're watching this man\n            shit in his own hand, preparing to fling it at you. There's too much\n            stuff inside this Hot Pocket. Seattle is actually Spanish for\n            \"taco.\" Those penguins are shitting Pong balls. Or, snow balls. Or I\n            guess shit balls, is what they are. Get your thumb out of your ass\n            and try playing games for once, why don't ya. The Kool-Aid Man never\n            had a flamethrower. I try not to affiliate myself with Canadians.\n            Too much in your wet diaper? Let's put our frowns on upside down,\n            and eat my buddy's leg. You're saying pipes don't have rights?\n            Fuckin' helicopters are the worst! They're trying to kill you as you\n            get in them. I've got a salty mustache. I am not smart enough to\n            know what any of that shit means. Who knows what direction that poop\n            is gonna take. Explain Baby Mario. Being there, and then all of the\n            sudden, poop floats up, hits the surface. Infinite beards. The cops\n            are here for the crimes against video games you've committed, Sonic.\n            I want it on this table. Are Depends real? Are adult diapers real?\n            Fuck your box!! You're banned, you're banned, you're Nintendo\n            banned! Oh, don't front, Jeff. You were already pooping your pants\n            before we even started recording. Can we enhance this? And Space\n            Pope himself, Mr. Patrick Klepek. You people are abject porn\n            monsters. You know what's not the new sweat? Hitler. I fuckin' love\n            Game Room. What a piece of shit. What an incredible, half-assed\n            piece of garbage this is. No rights for pipes, no rights for\n            pipes... I hate Game Room. I hate it. I actively hate it. I hate\n            sitting on the couch with you and looking at these stupid games.\n            I've got milk that's older than him. I should probably throw out\n            that milk. Hit the golf button. I've been a party to many, many\n            stupid things in my life. This is by far the stupidest. I was\n            dressed up like a pizza delivery guy; brought this F-bomb instead.\n            It's dumb, but its not transcendentally dumb. Sheep are incredibly\n            muscular. Penguins are dope. Hold on to your fucking hats,\n            gentlemen. I like that this is where we're at on Game Room: not even\n            games that were good enough to be put out. I will pay good money to\n            see you as a dirty sexual predator. YO THOSE ARE FUCKING\n            DOUBLE-UNDERLINE SICK. Don't milk a hippie. This is the result of\n            trying to touch butts. Prove that video games are good. At first I\n            cringe, but I want more. Why not just say KAIJU BATTLE ROBOT JOX?\n            Can we agree that buffalo sauce on your asshole would not feel good?\n            So you want a Hot Pocket with more pocket and less hot, is that what\n            you're saying? You are a human piece of shit. I could talk about\n            Peter Molyneux's balls for a long time. ExÃ©cutable? What the fuck\n            are you saying!? It's like they'd never seen a video game before and\n            they just decided, \"Oh, this is the best one, cause I've seen one.\"\n            This is like a fuckin' Woody Allen heist going on here.
